# Resume Builder

Welcome to the Resume Builder Website! 

This project allows users to create a personalized resume by entering their information into a form. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website guides users through the process of inputting their educational background, work experience, skills, and contact information. Upon submission, the website dynamically generates a formatted resume based on the user's input, providing a professional and customizable document ready for download or printing.

This project demonstrates my expertise in front-end web development, focusing on creating a user-friendly and functional tool for resume creation. With HTML for structuring content, CSS for styling and layout design, and JavaScript for form handling and resume generation logic, I've crafted an intuitive interface that simplifies the resume-building process. Whether you're crafting your first resume or updating your professional profile, the Resume Builder Website offers a seamless solution for creating polished resumes tailored to your individual experience and skills.
